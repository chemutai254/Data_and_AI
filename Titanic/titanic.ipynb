        "### **History of the `Titanic`**\n",
        "<p>The RMS Titanic was a British cruise ship that sank on April 15, 1912, during its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City. It was the largest ship in the world at the time, measuring 882 feet long and 92 feet wide, and displacing 52,310 long tons. The Titanic departed from Southampton on April 10, 1912, stopping at the French port of Cherbourg and the Irish port of Queenstown to pick up more passengers before setting off across the Atlantic Ocean.</p>\n",
        "<p>Despite receiving several ice warnings, the Titanic continued at full speed, and at 11 p.m. on April 14, 1912, lookout Fred Fleet spotted an iceberg dead ahead. First Officer William Murdoch ordered the ship turned hard to port and signaled the engine room to reverse direction, but the ship was too large, moving too fast, and the iceberg was too close. The Titanic struck the iceberg, causing several compartments to begin filling with water.</p>\n",
        "<p>The ship's design included a double-hull and 16 watertight compartments sealed by massive doors that could be instantly triggered by a single electric switch on the bridge or automatically by electric water-sensors. However, the ship was not designed to withstand a collision that would flood more than four compartments, and the iceberg had caused five compartments to begin filling with water. The ship began to sink, and the crew began to get people aboard the lifeboats. There were not enough lifeboats for all the passengers, and many left the Titanic only half full.</p>\n",
        "<p>The Titanic sank at 2 a.m. on April 15, 1912, with approximately 1,500 people still on board. The disaster led to the establishment of the International Ice Patrol and the first International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea, which required every ship to have lifeboat space for each person embarked, hold lifeboat drills, and maintain a 24-hour radio watch.</p>\n",
